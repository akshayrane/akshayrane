I’m @akshayrane

- **10+ yrs** building planet-scale, security-first cloud platforms — think resilience, reliability, repeatability.  
- *Shipped AWS-grade impact*: automated IAM cred rotations + CloudFormation API validations = tighter guardrails, smoother ops.  
- *Policy-as-code champ*: evolved CloudFormation Guard to supercharge CI/CD, compliance that devs actually love.  
- *Incident slayer*: high-sev firefights → root cause, fast fixes, lasting hardening.  
- *Tag whisperer*: drove metadata consistency with AWS Tagris to level-up org-wide visibility and governance.  
- *Team sport always*: collaborate, automate, and de-risk — from design docs to dashboards.  
- *Mission-mode*: build scalable, secure systems that make compliance invisible and velocity visible.
