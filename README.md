Iâ€™m @akshayrane

With over a decade of experience, I specialize in building scalable, secure cloud platforms and compliance-driven solutions. At AWS, I have contributed to critical projects such as automated IAM credential transitions and CloudFormation API validations, significantly enhancing platform security and operational efficiency. My work on AWS CloudFormation Guard advanced cloud compliance through policy-as-code innovations, streamlining CI/CD processes and improving user adoption rates.  

Passionate about solving complex engineering challenges, I have a proven track record of tackling critical incidents and delivering impactful solutions under pressure. Through a collaborative approach, I enabled metadata consistency with AWS Tagris and supported operational excellence across teams. My mission is to empower organizations with robust, scalable systems that prioritize security and compliance in the cloud.
